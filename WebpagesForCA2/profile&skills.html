        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
        When hiring an employee, the employer should first know a but about them, shouldn't they. As I said before, my name 
        is Ilodibia Chidebem. I graduated from Pan-Atlantic university with a Masters degree in Information Science and Media 
        Studies. You may not be able to tell at first glance, but I assure you that the course gave me much knowledge 
        regarding programming of websites and applications in multiple coding languages. I have about eight years of work experience, 
        with three of those years taking place while I was pursuing my Masters degree in graduate school. It is because of this 
        that I can say that I am able to work well in groups and under pressure. Since graduating, I have since taken multiple projects, 
        which you can see <a href=C:\Users\Chidebem\Documents\GitHub\CA2\WebpagesForCA2\portfolio.html>here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
        Due to the time I spent in working in internships and other jobs, I have learned how to work both independently and in large 
        teams. This has also caused me to develop good communication skills with my coworkers and employers, something that 
        is very necessary for programming. I am also very good at multitasking, as I am able to perform a wide range of complex 
        tasks such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>writing code</li> <li>planning and prototyping applications</li> <li>designing the architecture of application components</li> 
        <li>solving problems and fixing bugs</li> <li>testing sites and applications in different browsers or environments, and</li> <li>building APIs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>to name a few tasks I can perform. I have a very high level of attention to detail, which allows me to quickly pick up on any 
        errors that have been made. This coupled with my ability to multitask allows me to perform all sorts of tasks while still 
        meeting deadlines. As a general rule of thumb, I try to have all my work accomplishes at least a week to the deadline. 
        Additionally, I can teach myself new technical skills needed on the job. I also have experience with version control systems 
        as well as web security and encryption. Finally, I believe it goes without saying, but a web developer should be able to think 
        analyticaly and approach problems logically. These are also traits I have.
        </p>
