        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
        When hiring an employee, the employer should first know a but about them, shouldn't they. As I said before, my name 
        is Ilodibia Chidebem. I graduated from Pan-Atlantic university with a Masters degree in Information Science and Media 
        Studies. You may not be able to tell at first glance, but I assure you that the course gave me much knowledge 
        regarding programming of websites and applications in multiple coding languages. I have about eight years of work experience, 
        with three of those years taking place while I was pursuing my Masters degree in graduate school. It is because of this 
        that I can say that I am able to work well in groups and under pressure. Since graduating, I have since taken multiple projects, 
        which you can see <a href=C:\Users\Chidebem\Documents\GitHub\CA2\WebpagesForCA2\portfolio.html>here</a>.
